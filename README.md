Few scripts to animate AIS signal-reception in your web browser as demonstrated in this short video:

Steps:

1. Install dependecies (python, websockets, AIS-catcher)
2. Edit run.server to set your desired AIS-catcher settings
3. Start run server: ``./run.server``.
4. Open the file ``index.html`` in your web browser

You might need to fiddle a bit with the scripts as there is no proper error handling and there might be changes required depending on your system etc. These files are intended for experimentation with visualizing AIS radio reception.
